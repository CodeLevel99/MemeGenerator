# MemeGenerator
A meme generator created for Android mobile devices. Much faster than opening Paint (or Preview, can't forget the Mac users) on your computer and adding text boxes to your image.

Features include:

- taking pictures with your device and using it as a meme!
- choosing from a wide variety of pictures!
- inputing your own clever and witty words for your meme!
- runtime error when starting list view activity and click any of the options listed there (FIXED - Feb. 25, 2017 - you could now select new images)

Upcoming Features

- Accessing your images from your phone
- Changing fonts/colors of text
- Saving your meme to your phone

And then I'm abandoning this garbage application.
