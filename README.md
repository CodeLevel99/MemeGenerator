# MemeGenerator
A meme generator created for Android mobile devices. Saves maybe 20 more seconds than opening Paint on your computer and adding text boxes. 

Features include:

- taking pictures with your device and using it as a meme!
- choosing from a wide variety of pictures!
- inputing your own clever and witty words for your meme!
- runtime error when starting list view activity and click any of the options listed there (FIXED - Feb. 25, 2017 - you could now select new images)

Upcoming Features

- Accessing your images from your phone
- Changing fonts/colors of text
- Saving your meme to your phone

And then I'm abandoning this garbage application.
