# MemeGenerator
Project for learning Android development. 

The MemeGenerator is created for Android mobile devices that is designed for faster meme creation than opening Paint on your computer and adding text boxes to your images. So this app probably saves you about 20 seconds. 
:
Features include:

- taking pictures with your device and using it as a meme!
- choosing from a wide variety of pictures!
- inputing your own clever and witty words for your meme!
- runtime error when starting list view activity and click any of the options listed there (FIXED - Feb. 25, 2017 - you could now select new images)

You could now also save your newly created meme to phone gallery (be sure to allow MemeGenerator access your storage - Mar. 18, 2017).

But enough about the application. How are you doing?
